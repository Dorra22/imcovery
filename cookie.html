                            This Cookie Policy explains how Imcovery, Inc., uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website (“Site”) and use our Imcovery application that connects expatriates around the world (“App”). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            What is a Cookie?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A cookie is a small data file that is placed on your device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. A cookie may have unique identifiers and reside, among other places, on your device, in emails we send to you, and on the Site and when you connect to the App.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Cookies may be set by Imcovery or third-parties that perform services on our behalf. Cookies enable features or functionality in connection with our Site and App, for example, advertising, interactive content, and analytics. Cookies created by certain third-parties can recognize your device when you visit our Site or use the App and also when you visit certain other third-party websites.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We may use other technologies similar to cookies like web beacons, which are sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”. These are tiny graphic files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Site, connected to the App or opened an email that we have sent them. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Why Do We Use Cookies?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We Use Cookies for Several Reasons. Some are required for technical reasons in order for our Site and App to operate. Others provide a better experience on our Site and App by remembering some of your activities on the Site and App (including through our plug-ins, widgets, and embedded content). Other cookies enable more relevant advertising and better analytics.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Essential Cookies.

                            Cookies for Features and Services. Some cookies provide a better experience on our Site and App. For example, without cookies to remember some of your settings and activities on our Site or App, you would not be able to login automatically.

                            <br>

                            Third-Party Cookies.
