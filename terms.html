                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to our address:
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            c) a statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            19. THIRD PARTY APP STORE. The following additional terms and conditions apply to you if you download the App from a Third-Party Store. To the extent that the Third-Party terms and conditions are less restrictive than these Terms, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of these Terms, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms will apply, but solely with respect to the App and the Third-Party Store. You acknowledge and agree that:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            a) these Terms are concluded solely between you and Imcovery and not with the providers of the Third-Party Store, and Imcovery (and not the Third Party Store providers) is solely responsible for the App and the content thereof. To the extent that these Terms provide for usage rules for the App which are less restrictive or in conflict with the applicable terms of service of the Third Party Store from which you obtain the App, the more restrictive or conflicting term of the Third Party Store will take precedence and will apply.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            c) Imcovery, not the Third-Party Store provider, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any Third-Party may have relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and/or (iv) intellectual property infringement claims, to the extent not effectively disclaimed.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            d) the Third Party Store provider and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and, upon your acceptance of these Terms, the Third-Party Store provider from whom you obtained the App will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            a) Entire Agreement. These Terms (together with the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>) set forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all prior contemporaneous conversations, discussions and understandings, written or oral, with respect to such subject matter.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            b) Governing Law and Venue. These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of California, without resort to its conflict of law provisions. The state or federal court in San Francisco County, California will be the jurisdiction in which any suits should be filed if they relate to these Terms. Prior to the filing or initiation of any action or proceeding relating to these Terms, the parties will participate in good faith mediation in San Francisco County, California. If a party initiates any proceeding regarding these Terms, the prevailing party to such proceeding is entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for claims arising out of these Terms.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            c) Waiver. The waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same or any other provision. The failure by either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of the Terms shall not affect the right of the other party to require such performance in the future.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            d) Severability. If, for any reason, any of the Terms are declared illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court of a competent jurisdiction, then to the extent that term is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, it shall be severed and deleted from the Terms and the remainder of the Terms shall survive, remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding and enforceable.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            e) Assignment. You do not have the right to assign or otherwise to transfer such rights or obligations under these Terms without Imcovery’s the prior written consent of Imcovery, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            f) Changes. As we grow, we might have to make changes to these Terms, so we reserve the right to modify, amend or change the Terms at any time (a "Change"). If we do this then the Changes will be posted on this page and we will indicate the effective date of the updates at the bottom of the Terms. In certain circumstances, we may send an email to you notifying you of a Change. You should regularly check this page for notice of any Changes.
